<h2>Beta Release</h2>
<h3>Back ground and Motivation</h3>
<h4><p>In the most destructive disasters list till now, two of them in the top 4 are earthquakes. In spite of having the data related to the previously happened earthquake events, it is really hard to use that data to analyze for making future predictions. There is a lot of need to know the earthquake-prone areas and where more care should be taken. The motivation for choosing the dataset is to help the scientists get to know about which are the earthquake-prone areas also for the government to be prepared for facing such unexpected disasters to reduce the loss.</p></h4>
<h3>Description and objectives</h3>
<h4><p>The project is an attempt to help the researchers and people interested in geospacial science about earthquakes. The project is a story telling about the earthquakes happened in United States in last 2 years (2018-01-01 to 2020-10-28). It contains 4 main visualizations.</p></h4>
<ol>
    <li>What are the top three most earthquake-prone regions by the province/state in the United States?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Once the scientists can see which are the earthquake-prone regions they can study different statistics about these areas and compare them according to how much earthquake-prone the area is by getting how many earthquakes are happening in the region. Also, they can analyze which region is the most earthquake-prone of all.</li>
        <li>In order to get this insights we can see the data mapped on a United States' symbol map.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
