# Alpha Release        

### Background and motivation:
In the most destructive disasters list till now, two of them in the top 4 are earthquakes. In spite of having the data related to the previously happened earthquake events, it is really hard to use that data to analyze for making future predictions. There is a lot of need to know the earthquake-prone areas and where more care should be taken. The motivation for choosing the dataset is to help the scientists get to know about which are the earthquake-prone areas also for the government to be prepared for facing such unexpected disasters to reduce the loss.

### Description:
The project is an attempt to help the researchers and people interested in geospacial science about earthquakes. The project is a story telling about the earthquakes happened in United States in last 2 years (2018-01-01 to 2020-10-28). It contains 4 main visualizations.
1. Symbol map: symbol map of the regions where the earthquake strikes in 2018 and a user can select a year by filtering. Then for the same data the user can see subsequent followinf visualizations:
2. HeatMap: To analyze the trends in umber of earthquakes for particular regions.
3. Multiline chart: To analyze trends in the magnitudes of the earthquake in the selected regions.
4. Histogram: To see the trend between the magnitude of the earthquake and depth at which the earthquake struck.
This will help researchers to see functional details of the historic data about the earthquakes in USA for study.

### Overview:
The project will be composed of total four visualizations. In the first visualization, we will see the details of earthquakes in overall US and then we will move toward more deep level by considering top places where number of earthquakes is more. We will do analysis of such places using attributes like magnitude of earthquake and depth during a timestamps separately. Then, in the last visualization we will see how depth at which the earthquake struck and the ,agnitude of the earthquake are related to each other.
